Description
The game that I made is poker. It is a simple game with you(The player) and the computer. The objective of the game is to make the opponent
have less than 25 dollars. You win by getting pairs of cards like 3, 3. However, a 2,2,2 will beat a 9,9. The more pairs the better.
You can change the amount of money you and the opponent start with.

How to Play
The game only take numbers as inputs. 5, 10, and 15 are betting numbers while the rest are considered a "fold" which means you lose that
round and all the money you spent into it.

Interesting Features
1.Ability to change the money you start with
2.Opponent can put a higher bet than you
